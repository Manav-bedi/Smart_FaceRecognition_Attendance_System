# Smart Face Recognition Attendance System

A Python-based face recognition attendance system using OpenCV, the Face Recognition library, and Supabase.  
It detects faces through a webcam, matches them with pre-encoded images, and marks attendance in a cloud database with a live profile preview.

## Features
- Real-time face recognition.
- Cloud storage and database integration with Supabase.
- Profile preview with name, course, section, and attendance count.
- Automatic attendance logging.
- Face encoder utility for registering new students.

## Tech Stack
- Python (OpenCV, face_recognition, cvzone, numpy)
- Supabase (Database + Storage)
- Pickle (for storing face encodings)
